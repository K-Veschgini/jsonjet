# subscribe Statement

The `subscribe` statement subscribes to a stream for real-time data.

## Syntax

```jsonjet
subscribe <stream_name>
```

## Description

The `subscribe` statement creates a subscription to a stream, allowing you to receive real-time data from that stream. The subscription will print received data to the console.

## Parameters

- `stream_name`: Name of the stream to subscribe to (must be a valid identifier)

## Examples

### Basic Subscription

```jsonjet
subscribe sensor_data
subscribe events
subscribe logs
```

### Multiple Subscriptions

```jsonjet
subscribe temperature_stream
subscribe humidity_stream
subscribe pressure_stream
```

## Behavior

- Creates a subscription with a unique ID
- Prints received data to the console in the format: `ðŸ“¡ [stream_name]: data`
- Subscription remains active until manually unsubscribed
- Multiple subscriptions can be created to the same stream
- Subscription ID is returned for later unsubscription

## Output Format

When data is received, it's printed in this format:
```
ðŸ“¡ [sensor_data]: { "id": "sensor1", "temperature": 23.5, "timestamp": 1640995200 }
ðŸ“¡ [events]: { "type": "login", "user": "alice", "time": 1640995200 }
```
