# Project Status

## Current Development Stage

JSONJet is currently in technical preview. The core functionality is operational and available for evaluation, though I continue to refine the underlying architecture based on research findings.

## Development Philosophy

I've adopted a systematic architectural approach with JSONJet's development. Rather than implementing every mathematical function and aggregation operator immediately, my research strategy has focused on establishing the foundational infrastructure first.

The principle is straightforward: architectural decisions drive everything that follows. By implementing the most complex components first—query parser, transpiler, stream management, and real-time processing—subsequent mathematical functions and aggregations integrate naturally within the existing framework.

This research approach has prioritized:

- Stream processing architecture capable of high-throughput, real-time data handling
- Extensible query language parser designed to accommodate future operators
- Memory management systems optimized for edge computing environments
- Transpilation and execution engine providing comprehensive operational support

With these foundational systems established, incorporating additional mathematical functions, statistical aggregations, and analytics operators becomes a matter of leveraging existing infrastructure rather than requiring fundamental architectural modifications.

## Current Implementation Status

- Core stream processing engine
- Real-time flow creation and management
- Query language parser and transpiler
- Essential operators including where, select, scan, and summarize
- WebSocket and HTTP API interfaces

## Research Roadmap (2025 Q3)

- Server interface development
- Cross-stream querying and join operations
- Enhanced security layer implementation

## Research Collaboration

As JSONJet remains in technical preview, I welcome feedback from the research and development community. If you're evaluating the system or integrating it into your work, I'm particularly interested in your experiences, use cases, and any challenges you encounter. This input directly informs my research priorities and development decisions.

This methodical approach to development, while requiring more time initially, should yield a more robust and theoretically sound platform for long-term research and application.
