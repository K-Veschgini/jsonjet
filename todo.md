need now() func
need warning or error when monotonic assumed fields are not monotonic. 
better erros also when query fails, what query exactly. 

streams dont apepar in ui on create but on insert.

undefined must not appear in docs.

delete all stram shall not touch _ streams

remove flush // _log, numbers, results from console and add a real flush all?

large number of streams, no space for docs view

make sure functions (aggs and sclaras dont have same name and not called like a built in operator)
